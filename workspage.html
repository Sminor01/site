            <p>Currently, as an Executive Mixed Reality Producer for Entertainment Experiences for Meta's Reality Labs, I'm working with an incredible team to develop the next generation of mixed reality entertainment experiences.</p>
            <p>As Creative Director and Co-Lead for Tupa Labs' Bored Ape Yacht Club from 2023-2024, I was charged with amplifying the brand, expanding its reach, cementing its place in pop culture, and empowering its vibrant community of builders.</p>
            <p>From 2020-2023, I drove creative and strategy for WarpSound (formerly known as Warp Records) as Executive Creative Director, pushing the boundaries of adaptive AI music, virtual artistry, and interactive music experiences.</p>
            <p>From 2017-2021, I oversaw creative and production in multiple VP Creative roles at Live Nation across a wide array of multi-platform sponsorship and integrated marketing projects, as well as a variety of innovative, emerging media, broadcast, and extended reality (XR) content initiatives.</p>
            <p>Before Live Nation, I worked as CEO and Executive Creative Director across all of the design, branding, interactive, experiential, and content projects that came out of The Wylding Creative - the top-tier creative agency I re-founded in 2009 and grew into an award-winning integrated creative and production company with a studio location and $10M+ in annual gross revenue.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I've also had the pleasure of Executive Producing, Creative Directing, and Directing a wide array of award-winning music videos, commercials, branded content, and immersive experiences with a myriad of production companies, agencies, and some of the most culturally influential artists and brands in the world.</p>
